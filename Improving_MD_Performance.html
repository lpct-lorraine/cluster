<h1>Improving MD Performance</h1><p>+ How to Improve the Performance of Your MD Simulations
</p><p>The most important flags in the config file for NAMD are (with decreasing effect):
</p>
<ul><li> twoAwayX yes (or Y or Z)</li>
<li> PMEpencils</li>
<li> ldbUnloadOne and ldbUnloadPME</li></ul>
<p>These parameters and more are described on an older <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/wiki/?NamdPerformanceTuning">NAMD wiki page</a> at Urbana-Champaign, USA.
__Beware that this page is not entirely up to date; e.g, some of the parameters are not available anymore.__

NAMD usually manages domain decomposition on its own, defining a patch grid to split the system into smaller pieces. But sometimes, telling NAMD to actually split it into more patches along one coordinate can significantly improve the performance of your simulations. In general, switching on this option for the direction with smallest size (the least patches) leads to the most favorable results.
