PCI3018: New PCI card(s) have been detected in the system. Fan speeds may have changed to add additional cooling to the cards.
 2016-02-12T22:36:31+0100
Log Sequence Number: 69
Detailed Description:
New PCI card(s) have been detected in the system that may require additional airflow. Fan speeds may have changed to add additional cooling to the cards.
Recommended Action:
Changing default fan response to PCIe cards should be done with appropriate understanding of the PCIe cooling needs of the cards present in the system. If the automatic cooling response is insufficient, additional cooling can be added by one of the following methods. 1) From iDRAC Web GUI, click Hardware -&gt; Fans -&gt; Setup, then from the fan speed offset drop-down list appropriately select the cooling level needed or set the minimum fan speed to a custom value. 2) From F2 System Setup, select iDRAC Settings -&gt; Thermal, and set a higher fan speed from the fan speed offset or minimum fan speed. 3) For RACADM commands run "racadm help system.thermalsettings". If a lower fan speed is required, contact your service provider for the appropriate IPMI commands to reduce the default fan speed response for new PCIe cards.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Echange_mail_avec_Philippe">Echange mail avec Philippe</span></h3>
<p>Donc, pour une carte non qualifiée par Dell le serveur augmente la vitesse des ventilos à une valeur par défaut en fonction de la puissance estimée demandée par la carte. Mais on peut la réduire pour question de bruit, ça n'affectera pas un passage en vitesse supérieure en cas de surchauffe inopinée du local...??
</p><p>Je vais essayer ces commandes ipmi car en plus du bruit, je m'inquiète un peu sur la durée de vie des ventilateurs qui tournent à 14000 trs.
</p><p>Je me suis renseigné auprès de notre ingénierie, c’est bien une volonté de Dell de fonctionner ainsi.
</p><p>Sur le lien que vous avez partagé vous y trouverez 2 fichiers PDF qui explique cela.
</p><p>Our  thermal control starts with a baseline fan speed defined based on the specific  hardware in your system.  The fan speeds will never go below this level and  is set based on components that do not have temperature monitoring.  Then the thermal control uses closed-loop control algorithms to determine if and when to increase fan speeds to cool components that do have temperature monitoring.  The PCIe card responses  can increase fan speeds above the baseline.
</p><p>For Dell designed or qualified PCIe cards, our  servers identify the device and provide customized cooling for each card.  Many customers choose to use their own cards, and for that reason, we have designed the logic to detect these third-party PCIe  cards and provide a default cooling response based on an estimate of the cooling requirements for the card.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dell_Qualified_Card_Optimal_Response">Dell Qualified Card Optimal Response</span></h3>
<p>Our servers identify Dell qualified cards through proprietary communications.  All Dell designed cards and many Dell qualified cards have temperature monitoring capabilities.  Those capabilities are used to provide optimal cooling.  Cards without these capabilities are recognized and prescribed a predetermined response based on the card’s needs.
</p><p>Dell qualified cards have been thoroughly validated with our servers and require no additional management by our customers.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Third-Party_Card_Default_Response">Third-Party Card Default Response</span></h3>
<p>The automatic cooling response for third-party cards provisions airflow based on common industry card requirements. The baseline fan response increases as the ambient temperature rises. The figure also illustrates an example of how our controls categorize third-party cards based on how much power it thinks the card will consume and adds additional fan speeds as appropriate.  Since the PCIe card response adds to the baseline, the response for third-party cards also accounts for a change in ambient temperature.
</p><p>As the workaround if customer is still concerning on the fan speed too high or noise, we can try to disable “Thrid-Party PCIe card based default system fan response” as below:
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="From_iDRAC_Console">From iDRAC Console</span></h3>
<pre>
IPMICmd 20 30 0x00 ce 0 0x16 5 0 0 0 5 0 1 0 0  &gt; Set Unmatched Logic Disabled
IPMICmd 20 30 0x00 ce 0 0x16 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0  &gt;  Set Unmatched Logic Enabled
IPMICmd 20 30 0x00 ce 1 0x16 5 0 0 0  &gt;  Get Unmatched Logic Status
</pre>
<p>The response data is:
</p>
<pre>
0xc4 0xce 0x00 0x16 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x05 0x00 0x01 0x00 0x00(Disabled)
0xc4 0xce 0x00 0x16 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x05 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00(Enabled)
</pre>
<p><br />
Note that the ability to disable this feature only removes the fan response associated to the addition of third-party PCIe card and does not compromise original thermal algorithm based cooling needs. If the fan speeds were already high due to other system needs, then disabling this feature may not have an effect.

improvement that has been achieved using Intel Xeon® Phi on the current 
generation Dell servers as compared to the same server of CPU 
configuration only. Though the performance runs carried out consisted of
 multiple iterations of runs along with multiple BIOS options, only the 
best results are recorded in this blog. For each of the application, the
 settings which yielded the best performance are recorded in the results
 description for each of the applications. All the performance runs were
 carried out with hyper threading (logical processor) disabled. The

<p>Throughout this blog, the performance has 
been expressed comparing configuration 1 through configuration 3. There 
has been a considerable amount of performance gain that has been seen 
while scaling from CPU only configurations to servers with one and two 
Intel Xeon® Phi 7120P.
</p><p>Below are the details of the applications used for the study and the results obtained.
<i><b>High Performance Linpack</b></i>
 is the benchmark that would calculate the total throughput (sustained 
throughput) obtained from a system, this data can be used for 
calculating the overall efficiency by comparing it against the maximum 
theoretical throughput. For the below recorded run, CPU was set to 
Performance Mode and the Intel Xeon® Phi was set to ECC ON and Turbo 
OFF. The achieved throughput on CPU only was taken as the baseline. 
Below is the comparison of the scale-up performance runs carried out on 
configurations with processors and Intel Xeon Phi.

 (NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics program) is a molecular dynamics 
simulation package which uses the Charm++ parallel programming model. It
 has good parallel efficiency and is used to simulate large systems. 
Here the metric used is nano seconds/day. The benchmark has been run 
with three different datasets, namely ApoA1, ATPase and STMV. The 
performance numbers were recorded for CPU set to performance mode and 
the Intel Xeon® Phi set to ECC OFF and Turbo ON.

<p><i><b>ApoA1</b></i> gene provides 
instructions for making a protein called Apolipoprotein A-I. With the 
ApoA1 dataset, we observe 60% and 130% performance improvements on 
configuration with one and two Intel Xeon® Phi 7120P respectively as 
compared to CPU only configurations.
</p><p><i><b>ATPase</b></i> are a class of enzymes 
that catalyze the decomposition of ATP into ADP and free phosphate ion. 
With the ATPase dataset, we observe 55% and 130% performance 
improvements on configuration with one and two Intel Xeon® Phi 7120P 
respectively as compared to CPU only configurations.
</p><p><i><b>STMV</b></i> (Satellite Tobacco Mosaic
 Virus) is a small, icosahedral plant virus. With the STMV dataset, we 
observe 60% and 130% performance improvements on configuration with one 
and two Intel Xeon® Phi 7120P respectively as compared to CPU only 
configurations.
</p><p>ANSYS Mechanical
 is a comprehensive FEA analysis (finite element) tool for structural 
analysis, including linear, nonlinear and dynamic studies. The 
performance numbers were recorded for CPU set to performance mode and 
the Intel Xeon® Phi set to ECC ON and Turbo OFF. The best performance 
was seen with 16 cores. The behavior is as expected and the details for 
the same can be found here.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Concluding_remarks:">Concluding remarks:</span></h3>
<p>It has been noted from the results as 
recorded above that there is a considerable amount of performance gain 
for most of the applications when using Intel Xeon® Phi with performance
 improvements in the range of up to 300% across the chosen spectrum of 
applications and the add-on Intel Xeon® Phi configuration. Overall the 
users can take advantage of superior performance of the latest Dell 
PowerEdge® Server powered by Intel Xeon® E5-26xxv3 with support for new 
extensions coupled with increased memory speed from DDR3 to DDR4.
