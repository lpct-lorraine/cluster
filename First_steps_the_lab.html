</p><p>The lab is a agglomeration of several small groups with a common topic, here it is "Theoretical Chemistry and Biochemistry" (CBT, the French acronym).
The Director
</p><p>The leader is Manuel Ruiz-Lopez.
The Organiser (Secretary)
</p><p>We are fortunate to have Aurelie Chape as a secretary/assistant. She is responsible for handling administrative matters such as vacation forms, traveling planning and booking, as well as providing a range of basic office equipment, e.g., envelopes, pencils, marker, etc.
How to get here?
</p><p>The university is open from Monday til Friday between 7am and 8pm(?). For any other times, a key card or an entrance code is required. Ask you colleagues for these.
</p><p>To enter the closed lab on 7th floor, there are three entrances plus one elevator. The elevator itself is locked for this floor. So you would need a key which only permanent personal usually gets. But there are other elevators on this floor closer or farther to the lab entrances. For most of the doors, a key card can be used to enter. Additionally, there is an older set of keys for members of the lab, one for the office itself and another one for the entrance next to the locked elevator.
Hint: You could this elevator to get to the 6th floor, climb the stairs to the 7th and enter through this door with the old keys…
