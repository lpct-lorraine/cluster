<h1>Remote Connections</h1><p>This page introduces the usual ways to connect to other machines from your own PC or laptop using [wikipedia:Secure_Shell SSH] and related tools.

</p><p>+ How to directly connect to another machine?
</p>
<ul><li> Linux: SSH is required which is usually installed per default with common distributions</li>
<li> Windows: Download [*<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external free" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a> putty] (which uses SSH as well)</li></ul>
<p>+ How to copy data between your machine and another one?
</p>
<ul><li> In Linux, the SSH package contains //scp//, which can be used similar to the the common //cp// command:</li></ul>
<pre>* upload: scp (local file) (remote machine):(remote path)
* download: scp (remote machine):(remote file) (local path)
</pre>
<ul><li> For Windows, the programme <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external text" href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a> is recommendable.
<ul><li>Comment: For some Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, only part of the SSH package is installed (the client part).** If you intend to login to your office PC from somewhere else, you need to have the complete package installed. (For Ubuntu 11 &amp; 12, it is called "Secure shell client and server (metapackage)").</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>+ Advanced SSH Options
++ Setup
The SSH configuration file, the SSH identity files etc. are stored in $HOME/.ssh for Linux. To simply your remote connections and to easily establish SSH tunnels,
A sample configuration file is can be found <a href="page_not_existing.html" style='color:red' class="new" title="File config (page does not exist)"> here</a>. It contains parameters for all sessions (Host *), for specific domains (*lctn.uhp-nancy.fr), and for particular machines (curie, login.uhp). Additionally, you can specify particular identity files such as in the last block. Note that the description or name after Host is an alias for the settings in the lines thereafter. Hence, if you want to connect to curie without having to remember its host name as well as your account name there, just enter the information in this file and use the alias instead.
</p>
<ul><li><ul><li>The file will be read every time you use an SSH command like //ssh, scp, etc.//**</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>The __advantage__ for using this file is to simplify the input upon connecting as well as it does not require to remember the name of the remote machine as well as your account name. All is stored well ordered in this file which can be copied to other computers and altered there for similar usage. Furthermore, as this is directly configuring your SSH connections, all programmes and tools which use SSH can use the same information, e.g., //fish// an  interactive data transfer tool which works with your file manager (nautilus, dolphin, etc.).
</p><p>++ Connecting without entering the password?
That is possible in most cases, as long as the administrator of the remote machine did not disable it.
Therefore, you need to distribute your SSH [wikipedia:Public_key public key]...
</p><p>1. Generate your SSH key pair (private and public)
</p>
<ul><li> If there are no identity files in your $HOME/.ssh, such as id_rsa (private key) &amp; id_rsa.pub (public key)</li></ul>
<pre>* Then run //ssh-keygen// to generate new ones
* Do not forget to enter a passphrase (without it, your secure connection is compromised and especially the computer centers would not be happy about that...)
</pre>
<ul><li><ul><li>Note** that on modern systems, an //ssh-agent// is handling your identities. Hence, if you want to connect with this identity, the agent will store your passphrase. This way you have to enter the passphrase only once.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>2. Copy the public key to the remote machine(s)
The public keys from remote machines are stored in $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys. This allows you to connect from this machines to the one with the corresponding authorized_keys content.
</p>
<ul><li> The command //ssh-copy-id// allows to securely copy your public key to any other machine you want to connect to. Moreover, it creates the authorized_keys file if it is not present yet.</li></ul>
<pre>* In case of an older SSH version, this tool might not be present. Therefore, you  have to manually copy the content of id_rsa.pub to the authorized_keys file on the remote machine. **Do not** overwrite this remote file as it might contain additionally keys already.
</pre>
<p>For example: If you want to connect to curie, the authorized_keys file on curie should contain the public key of your local machine.
</p><p>++ Tunneling through a login node
<a href="#_sshtunnel"># sshtunnel</a>
Another very useful feature is to create an [wikipedia:Tunneling_protocol SSH tunnel] to connect to a remote machine which is hidden behind a firewall or login node.
For example, if you want to connect to your office PC at the university in Nancy from somewhere else, you have to go via __host20__ which acts as gate.
</p><p>The __advantage__ of using tunnels is that you can connect multiple times through one tunnel to your remote machine. Furthermore, you can directly copy data between both machines without copying to the gate in between.
</p><p>This process has two steps:
</p>
<ol><li> Setting up your tunnel</li>
<li> Connecting to the machine behind</li></ol>
<p>As you can see in the <a href="page_not_existing.html" style='color:red' class="new" title="File config (page does not exist)"> sample configuration file</a>, there are two blocks, one for each of the two steps. The example there connects to a machine at loria, called "mbiserver".
</p><p>In the following, this will be used to illustrate the tunnel scheme:
</p>
<ol><li> Connect to the login node "loria.loria.fr" and tell SSH to set up a local port 7707 on your machine which forwards to "mbiserver.loria.fr" with the default SSH port 22</li>
<li> Use the tunnel to go from your machine "localhost" via port 7707</li></ol>
<ul><li><ul><li>Note:** As all the hosts you connect to are verified and registered in a file called "known_hosts", "localhost" is not unique anymore, if you are using tunnels. Hence, the known_hosts file for each tunnel is separated. Potential_Calculation_Programm</li></ul></li></ul>
