<h1>First steps/technical Matters</h1><p>User accounts
</p><p>You need to get an university account which comprises your email address as well. Furthermore, a local lab account will be required allowing you to login from the outside to your office computer via host20. For details on this see the SSH description for tunneling.
</p>
<pre>   Default group and previous user IDs should be equal on all local machines
   They can be found in /etc/passwd
       group&#160;: edam (GID 600)
       range of user IDs&#160;: 600+
</pre>
<p>Emails
</p><p>In general, your email address will be "(first name).(family name)@univ-lorraine.fr". In some cases, such as post docs the current policy is to only provide older address names with "@uhp-nancy.fr".
</p><p>More importantly, there is a lab mailing list which is frequently used to spread information and plan upcoming events: "cbt.tous@uhp-nancy.fr". Please ask Francesca Ingrosso to be added to the list.
The Group's Calendar
</p><p>There is a group calendar via Google which allows to coordinate the schedules and upcoming conferences. Please ask a colleague to be invited to this one.
Access to Journals and Publications on the Web
</p><p>You can use the university's proxy server therefore.
In your network settings, enter "cache.uhp-nancy.fr" with port 3128 for all.
Printers
The big Toshiba all-in-one machine
</p>
<pre>   Name: TOSHIBA e-STUDIO255
   IP address: 193.50.239.202
</pre>
<p>The smaller HP printer
</p>
<pre>   Name: HP LaserJet 4250
   IP address: 193.50.239.201
</pre>
<p>How to find them?
Your computer usually has a printer menu, where you are offered to add/search new machines. These printers should show up as network printers with there name.
If this is not the case, try searching them using their IP address as described above.
Available machines on site
</p><p>This group has a file server, for storing large amount of data, and a small compute cluster at hand, which are almost next door.
You can establish a direct data connection by mounting your directories on those machines on your own UNIX machine (Linux or Mac OSX).
</p>
<pre>   Therefore, edit /etc/fstab and add the following lines:
</pre>
<ol><li>file server UHP</li></ol>
<p>rabat1.lctn.uhp-nancy.fr:/data1 /mnt/rabat1/data1 nfs
rabat1.lctn.uhp-nancy.fr:/data2 /mnt/rabat1/data2 nfs
rabat2.lctn.uhp-nancy.fr:/home /mnt/rabat2/home nfs
</p>
<pre>   Enter the following to mount altogether: mount -a
   For manual mounting to test a set up, e.g.: mount -t nfs rabat2.lctn.uhp-nancy.fr:/home /mnt/rabat2/home
</pre>
<p>Hint To easily access these directories, simply add a symbolic link into your home directory, e.g.: ln -s /mnt/rabat2/home/$USER rabat2
This link allows you to go from your home directory directly to your directory on rabat2 ($USER has to be your account name).
File server rabat1
</p><p>The data on this machine is split into two domains, data1 and data2. Check with one of the administrating persons in the group, where your directory will be.
Compute cluster rabat2
</p><p>This cluster has two kinds of nodes, all of them connected via an Infiniband network, an older part with Intel Xeon CPUs and a newer one with AMD Interlagos CPUs. For more details have a look into the section "Rabat2" of the HPC cluster page.
</p><p>To run your calculations on rabat2, a job script is useful. There are two scripts attached to this page, one for NAMD and another one for Gromacs. While the NAMD script is set to run on a Xeon node, the one for Gromacs is set to an Interlagos node.
Backing Up your Data
</p><p>Please have your home directory on rabat2 to rabat1 synced once in a while (by someone with the root access):
</p><p>rsync -aqzH /home/(your user account) root@rabat1.lctn.uhp-nancy.fr:/data2/RABAT2
</p><p>This will synchronise the content of your rabat2 directory with the one on rabat1:/data2/RABAT2.
</p>
